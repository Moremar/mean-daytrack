### Purpose

DayTrack is a tool allowing users to keep track of the books, comics, movies, series and games they have read, watched or played.

The following information can be saved :
  - Title
  - Author / Director
  - Creation year
  - Actors (movies and series only)
  - Summary
  - Image
  - Console (games only)
  - Volume (comics only)
  - Season (series only)
  - Watched/read/played date


### Setup

DayTrack is a web application using the MEAN stack (frontend in Angular, backend in Node.js using the Express framework and a MongoDB database).

To run it locally :
 - npm install
 - ng serve -o --port 3311   (any available port is fine)
 - cd backend/
 - nodemon server.js --config ../nodemon.json (must set the DB infos first in nodemon.json)
